# instagramhacks
Hi guys, I was hacked instagram by sending multiple follow requests from single or multiple account on every 30s.

I uploaded the script for sending multiple request on here. It's kinda realy an easy stuff. Everyone can do this.

# Steps to send request
1. You need a server (Apache + PHP). Use wamp server my suggestion.
2. Open your instagram account
3. Choose your end user
4. Open web deeloper -> network panel
5. Send follow request to that end user
6. You can see follow request on network panel
7. Get the headers, cookies and url from the network panel and modify the script as per the details
8. Open your command prompt or browser to run this script
9. Use VPN and also stop the running script on a periodic time and change the VPN

I've been reported to instagram about this. So use it quickly and make fun with friends. 

# Note
1. Don't forgot to rotating IP address

Thank you guys,
Gokul J S
